						<p><strong>Lego</strong><br/><br/></p>
						<p>The Lego is the first project that students create for the CSANM-150: Intro to 3D Graphics course.  I chose to create a Lego based on the League of Legends Character, Lux.  I redid the entire scene when I applied to the emphasis.</p>

					<div class='portfolio-text-item'>
						<p><strong>Bug</strong><br/><br/></p>
						<p>The Bug is the second and last project that students create for CSANM-150. This got entirely redone when I applied to the emphasis.  The original bug was thematically based on Tron.  While the color scheme is similar, the actual model differs greatly from it's predecessor.  This Bug is more inspired by robotics and computer hardware as well as the giant robot in The Incredibles. </p>

						<p><strong>Still Life</strong><br/><br/></p>
						<p>This is the image that I created for the CSANM-250: Intermediate 3D Graphics course.  While I was unable to fully participate in the class due to health reasons, I still completed this image.  This is the image that had the least rework when I applied to the emphasis.  Most people say that the image reminds them of Toy Story, though that was not the inspiration.</p>
